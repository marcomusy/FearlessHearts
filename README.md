Ten years ago, a population of cardiac progenitor cells was identified
 in pharyngeal mesoderm that gives rise to a major part of the amniote heart.
 These multipotent progenitor cells, termed the second heart field (SHF),
 contribute progressively to the poles of the elongating heart tube during
  looping morphogenesis, giving rise to myocardium, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells.

Arid3b, a member of the conserved ARID family of transcription
factors, is essential for mouse embryonic development but its precise
roles are poorly understood.
Arid3b is expressed in the myocardium of the tubular heart and in second heart field
progenitors.

Arid3b-deficient embryos show cardiac abnormalities,
including a notable shortening of the poles, absence of myocardial
differentiation and altered patterning of the atrioventricular canal,
which also lacks epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.
Proliferation and death of progenitors as well as early patterning of the heart
appear normal.

Arid3b is thus required for heart development by regulating
the motility and differentiation of heart progenitors. These findings
identify Arid3b as a candidate gene involved in the aetiology of human
congenital malformations.
